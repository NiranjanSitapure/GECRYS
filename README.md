# GECRYS
Generalized Crystallization Solver (GECRYS) is a low-code and fast crystallization modeling and control framework specifically designed to provide easy simulation of various crystallization systems. As an example, two case studies along with their Jupyter files are included. Furthermore, a model predictive controller (MPC) module is demonstrated for controlling the crystal size and distribution.

Please unzip the .rar files, and open the JUPYTER file for CASE 1 and CASE 2 to get a description of the crystallization model, various equations, and how to simulate a crystallization system with minimal coding required.

The MPC module is in the CASE 3 folder, and can be accessed by opening the CASE_3_MPC_receding_horizon.py file.
